People with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) experience the consequences of poor sleep: they feel sleepy and fatigued in waking hours. Some report headaches and trouble with concentration and memory. Some feel irritable and depressed.

Women with obstructive sleep apnea may not snore as loudly as men with the disorder, but are more apt to report symptoms of depression and insomnia.

Obstructive sleep apnea forces the heart and blood vessels to work harder. If left untreated, it may cause high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and impotence.
