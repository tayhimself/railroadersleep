Treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) aims to restore normal breathing in sleep, ease wake-time symptoms, such as fatigue and sleepiness, and reduce the risk of experiencing medical disorders, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and impotence. Effective treatments exist. They include:

**Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).** This is the gold standard treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It can reduce, and sometimes eliminate obstructive sleep apnea symptoms. CPAP involves wearing a mask over the nose, or over both nose and mouth in sleep. The CPAP device sends a constant, low-pressure stream of air to keep the airway open. Advances in technology have made CPAP devices portable and as compact as 3.6 inches in diameter. Railroaders who must overnight at stations away from their home and who require CPAP may find that such a device will easily fit in their overnight bag.

 **Oral appliances.** These dental devices, worn in the mouth, aim to reposition the lower jaw forward and keep the airway open. They may benefit people with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, but some with severe obstructive sleep apnea may benefit as well.

**Sleep position.** Some people experience sleep-disrupted breathing only when they sleep on their back. Place pillow bolsters on the side of your body, or attach objects to the back of pajamas, such as tennis ball in a sock, to help discourage back-sleeping. Commercial devices that discourage back-sleeping also exist. One, worn on the back of the neck, starts to vibrate when a person sleeps on his or her back, prompting the sleeper to shift position.

**Oral appliances.** These dental devices, worn in the mouth, aim to reposition the lower jaw and keep the airway open. They may benefit people with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

**Surgery.** Several surgical procedures may be useful for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
 	- Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) or its variants focus on reducing excessive tissue in the throat and/or the tongue in order to widen the airway. It may benefit some people with obstructive sleep apnea.
 	- Bariatric (weight reduction surgery) in people with obstructive sleep apnea who are overweight may decrease the severity or eliminate it entirely.
 	- Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (Inspire速) is a recently approved device for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. An electrode is surgically placed next to the hypoglossal nerve which is the primary nerve controlling the tongue. The device senses when you begin to breathe and then causes the electrode to stimulate the tongue muscle. This prevents collapse of the airway. Currently, hypoglossal nerve stimulation is only indicated for people who cannot use CPAP, are not extremely obese and have obstructive sleep apnea that is moderate to severe. There are other eligibility criteria as well and the device and implantation procedure are very expensive. Consultation with a sleep specialist is essential to determine if you are eligible to have this procedure.

 **Medications.** To date, there are no medications when used alone that have been shown to be effective for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. However, some people may experience persistent sleepiness even after effective treatment for their obstructive sleep apnea. For these individuals, medications such as modafinil (Provigil速), armodafinil (Nuvigil速) or solriamfetol (Sunosi速) may improve their sleepiness when used with their obstructive sleep apnea treatment.
If you have obstructive sleep apnea, successful treatment likely will help you sleep better, and stay more alert and focused in waking hours. It will enable you to perform your job better, and improve your odds of staying safe at work and while driving.
