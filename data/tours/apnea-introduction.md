Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that affects a significant portion of the population. It occurs when the upper airway becomes partially or completely blocked during sleep, leading to interruptions in breathing and causing oxygen levels in the blood to drop.

This can result in a range of symptoms, including loud snoring, gasping or choking during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating. OSA can also lead to more serious health issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.

The importance of OSA to railroaders and safety is significant. Sleep deprivation and fatigue can impair cognitive functioning and reaction time, increasing the likelihood of errors and accidents.
