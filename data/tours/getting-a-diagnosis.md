Overweight middle-aged men have the highest risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a disorder that disrupts breathing during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea affects women, too, most commonly after menopause. It even affects babies and children, particularly those who have enlarged tonsils, or are overweight.

Excess weight boosts a person's risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. Excess fat not only envelopes the outside of the body but also surrounds tissues inside the body. Excess fat on throat tissues increases the likelihood of airway blockage. Certain inherited traits, such as a small jaw or a large overbite, may increase the risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. Consuming alcohol or a medication containing an opioid such as hydrocodone (Vicodin®) oxycodone (OxyContin®, Percocet®) near bedtime may further worsen breathing while sleeping in people with obstructive sleep apnea.

While an estimated 18 million Americans have  obstructive sleep apnea, many do not realize they have it. They understandably don’t know they have symptoms that occur only in sleep. A family member or bed partner may be the first to recognize their problem snoring, fatigue, and other symptoms:

- Do you snore loudly?
- Do you often feel sleepy or foggy while awake?
- Has someone told you that you stop breathing or choke or gasp in your sleep?
- Are you overweight?
- Do you have poorly controlled high blood pressure?

If you answered “yes” to these questions, you have symptoms that suggest you may have obstructive sleep apnea.  You can find out more about your risk for obstructive sleep apnea by filling out the Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool. TODO - link

Discuss your symptoms with a healthcare provider. This person may refer you to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. If you do have obstructive sleep apnea, treatment can help you sleep better, feel better while awake, and perform well in your safety-critical railroad job.


### How Sleep Specialists Diagnose OSA

Obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, can be diagnosed in a number of ways.

A sleep specialist will ask how you sleep, and how you feel when awake, and perform a physical exam. You may be asked to complete the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and other measures of sleepiness. You also may be asked to have blood and urine tests, and undergo studies to examine the anatomy of your airway.

Additionally, you will need to undergo a sleep study. These are now usually performed in the home with equipment that you can easily put on by yourself. However, in some cases, they may need to be done at a sleep center. Sleep studies can show whether you have obstructive sleep apnea, and, if so, how severe it is.

If you undergo a home sleep study, you will wear devices to assess breathing patterns and oxygen levels. At a sleep center, technicians will attach electrodes to your scalp and elsewhere on your body to monitor brain activity, breathing patterns, and heart rate. They also will measure oxygen levels in your blood.
