### Overview Questions

**Q. What is the Railroaders’ Guide to Healthy Sleep?**

**A.** [The Railroaders’ Guide to Healthy Sleep](https://railroadersleep.fra.dot.gov), provides evidence-based tools, tips and information to help railroaders—as well as families and friends—learn about and improve their sleep as well as to find a healthy balance in life. The Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool helps you check up on your own sleep health. While any transportation industry employee may benefit from the information at the website, this site is designed to meet the specific needs of railroaders.

**Q. Why is sleep so important to railroaders?**

**A.** Sleep is vital for all of us. We can’t live without it. The railroader lifestyle makes it particularly challenging to attain sufficient quality sleep. For example, many railroaders work on-call and have unpredictable schedules. Insufficient sleep creates safety risks and negatively impacts health over the long-term so it’s especially essential for railroaders to learn how to get the best sleep possible. Good sleep can improve railroaders’ safety and health, both on and off the job.

- Railroad Companies: Human Resources departments, staff nurses, Employee Assistance Programs and company intranets can all help improve safety and job satisfaction by sharing this site with employees.

### Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool Questions

**Q. What is the Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool?**

**A.** A cornerstone of the site is the Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool, an anonymous self-assessment that provides real-time results regarding respondents’ risk for sleep disorders, and provides resources to facilitate treatment if needed to address sleep problems. The Tool takes about 10 minutes to complete. You can then print out your results to share with a healthcare provider. It is completely anonymous. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when you exit.

Q: What does taking this quiz involve?

A: When you click the link to the quiz, your web browser will redirect you to a secure Mass General Brigham hospital website. The quiz takes about 10 minutes to complete. It asks about your experience with common symptoms of sleep disorders, such as snoring, or feeling a recurrent urge to move your legs when you sit or lie down.

After you complete the quiz, a computer program will review your answers. It estimates your risk of having one or more sleep disorders, and provides a notice on your screen telling you if you are at increased risk. You may print this notice to share with a healthcare provider. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when you exit.

You also will receive a link to http://www.sleepcenters.org/. Use the zip code lookup feature from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to find accredited sleep specialists in your area.

Q: Will personal information be collected?

A: No. The screening tool is completely anonymous. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when you exit. If you cannot complete the questions in one sitting and choose to return later, you will need to start over.

Q: I sleep fine. Why should I complete this quiz?

A: It's easy to overlook symptoms that occur only or mainly while you sleep. Most of us are also not the best at objectively assessing these types of symptoms. The quiz will ask about your sleep in a typical week and on vacations. Taking the quiz may alert you to a pattern of symptoms you may wish to discuss with a healthcare provider.

Q: I already know I have a sleep disorder. I'm receiving treatment for it. Why should I take this quiz?

A: People with one sleep disorder may be at risk for others. Taking the quiz may help alert you to new or different symptoms to discuss with a healthcare provider. It will also inform the effectiveness of your current treatments.

Q: Suppose I learn I am at risk for a sleep disorder, but do not wish to see my healthcare provider?

A: Even if you decide not to seek medical help now, pay attention to possible symptoms. If your problems persist, retake the quiz in a few months. When you next see a healthcare provider, consider discussing these problems.

Q: Who will have access to my replies to the quiz?

A: Only you. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when your session ends.
