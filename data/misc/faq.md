**Q. Why is sleep so important to railroaders?**

**A.** Sleep is vital for all of us. We can’t live without it. Many railroaders work on-call and have unpredictable schedules, so it’s especially essential for them to know how and when to get the best sleep possible. Good sleep can improve railroaders’ safety and health, both on and off the job.

### Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool Questions

**Q. What is the Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool?**

**A.** A cornerstone of RailroadSleep.org is the Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool, an online, private self-assessment that helps identify personal risk for sleep disorders, and find help if needed to address sleep problems. The Tool takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. You can then print out your results to share with a healthcare provider. It is completely anonymous. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when you exit.

Q: What does taking this quiz involve?

A: When you click the link to the quiz, your web browser will redirect you to a secure Brigham and Women's Hospital website. The quiz takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. It asks about your experience with common symptoms of sleep disorders, such as snoring, or feeling a recurrent urge to move your legs when you sit or lie down.

After you complete the quiz, a computer program will review your answers. It estimates your risk of having one or more sleep disorders, and provides a notice on your screen telling you if you are at risk. You may print this notice to share with a healthcare provider. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when you exit.

You also will receive a link to http://www.sleepcenters.org/. Use the zip code lookup feature from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to find accredited sleep specialists in your area.

Q: Will personal information be collected?

A: No. The screening tool is completely anonymous. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when you exit. If you cannot complete the questions in one sitting and choose to return later, you will need to start over.

Q: I sleep fine. Why should I complete this quiz?

A: It's easy to overlook symptoms that occur only or mainly while you sleep. The quiz will ask about your sleep in a typical week and on vacations. Taking the quiz may alert you to a pattern of symptoms you may wish to discuss with a healthcare provider.

Q: I already know I have a sleep disorder. I'm receiving treatment for it. Why should I take this quiz?

A: People with one sleep disorder may be at risk for others. Taking the quiz may help alert you to new or different symptoms to discuss with a healthcare provider.

Q: Suppose I learn I am at risk for a sleep disorder, but do not wish to see my healthcare provider?

A: Even if you decide not to seek medical help now, pay attention to possible symptoms. If your problems persist, retake the quiz in a few months. When you next see a healthcare provider, consider discussing these problems.

Q: Who will have access to my replies to the quiz?

A: Only you. Any information you enter is automatically deleted when your session ends.
