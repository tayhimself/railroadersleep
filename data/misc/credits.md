The Railroaders' Guide to Healthy Sleep website was produced by the [U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe Center (Volpe)](https://www.volpe.dot.gov/) in Cambridge, MA, and is sponsored by the [Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)](https://railroads.dot.gov/), U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT). Originally launched on June 11, 2012, in collaboration with the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine, the site was updated by the Volpe Center in 2015, serving as a major educational initiative for the railroad industry about the importance of sleep health. The site was updated again in 2023 by many of the original investigators at Harvard Medical School to ensure the recommendations reflect the current state of the evidence.
