Sleep strategies differ from person to person, yet there are some approaches that are consistently used with good success among railroaders.

- **If you know you won't be going to work** for 14 or 18 hours, try to schedule your sleep accordingly. Maybe take a nap immediately to refresh, then get more sleep later, closer to work time.

- **If you are uncertain about your next start time**, then sleeping immediately is your best bet, so that you don't get caught short.

- **Make use of time waiting in a siding.** Naps and exercise both can boost alertness. If your company permits napping, take a nap when you can. If you must wait longer than that in a siding, take a walk, if possible. Jog or stretch in place. Many apps provide a 10-minute workout you can do anywhere.

- **Install shades or blackout curtains in the bedroom.** This will benefit sleep at any time. If away from home, consider using pants hangers from the closet to clip the curtains together to block light during the day.

- **Install good soundproofing where you sleep**, so that family members don’t have to tiptoe around the house while you are sleeping.

- **Adjust room temperature to your liking.** Most people sleep better in a cool room, with the thermostat set between 60o F and 68o F.

- **Place extra blankets nearby** on the bed in case you get too cold.
