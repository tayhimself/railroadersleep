Sufficient sleep recharges the battery in your brain. In well-rested adults, the battery charge lasts approximately 16 hours. In those hours, you should feel alert, have an upbeat mood, think clearly, make decisions easily, and perform well at work.

If you need eight hours of sleep, but get only six hours, you will charge your battery only part way. It will drain faster than a battery that is fully charged. You likely will feel sleepier sooner, and your performance may deteriorate faster than it otherwise would. Missed sleep undermines many aspects of daily functioning, from your ability to recognize and respond to signals in your environment to your ability to interact socially, including thinking creatively, maintaining a cool, calm demeanor, and remembering your conversations clearly the next day.

People with regular work hours often go to bed around the same time on work days. Many set an alarm clock, while others awaken at the same time on their own. That means they get consistent amounts of sleep.

Railroaders with on-call schedules or fixed hours that fluctuate over the week likely go to bed and get up at different times on different days. They often get varying amounts of sleep and likely sleep less than those with regular work hours. Given that irregular sleep schedules are associated with adverse health outcomes, it is important to keep as consistent a sleep schedule as your work hours allow.
