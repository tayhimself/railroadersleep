Many railroaders work on-call, at different times of day, all days of the week. Their hours of sleep and wakefulness may change a lot from day to day. Even railroaders on regular schedules often end up working overtime for which they cannot prepare in advance, creating similar lifestyle challenges.

Railroaders may have to sleep away from home several days each week. The hours available for sleep may not be sufficient or at the optimal time on their body clocks. Attempting sleep at varying times may make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep, and to get enough sleep. Because humans sleep best at night, trying to do so during the day often proves challenging.

Irregular hours for work and sleep, particularly when they do not sync up with one's body clock, underlies the condition of shift work disorder.

People with shift work disorder report experiencing trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and/or feeling excessively sleepy at work, when they need to stay sharp. They may also report that their sleep is unrefreshing or insufficient. Some describe difficulty concentrating, and diminished energy and motivation in waking hours, all worrisome because of their potential consequences for safety on the job and while driving. They may feel irritable or depressed, experiences that may cause difficulty in their interpersonal relationships and family life.

People with shift work disorder sometimes devote major parts of their free time to catching up on sleep. This practice may cut into their family time and social life.
