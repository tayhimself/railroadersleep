quote: "Even if people who must sleep in the daytime do everything right—give themselves enough time in bed, create a totally dark room, soundproof the entire thing—they probably still won't sleep as well as they would if they slept at night because of alerting signals from their underlying biological clock. These tactics still are worth doing. They can help people who must sleep in the daytime maximize their opportunity for sleep."

**Block out street light and daylight.** People sleep better in a dark room. Put black vinyl on your bedroom window at home, or install black-out curtains or shades. Wear an eye mask, if necessary.

**Soundproof bedroom windows and doors**, with absorptive padding. Consider sleeping in a basement or attic, if available, away from household activity, when you’re on-call. Install carpeting to help muffle sounds. Use earplugs to block out a spouse's alarm clock, children's chatter, and other household noises. Also consider using a white noise machine that provides an even background hum, or recordings of ocean waves or rain. A fan or air conditioner can mask noises, too. When away from home, try tuning your radio to the static at the end of the dial.

**Disable the ringer on the household telephone in your bedroom.** Lower your cell phone’s volume, and assign a specific ringtone to the dispatcher, and other key contacts. Turn off notifications before you go to sleep.

**Turn your bedside clock away from you**, or consider tossing a towel over the clock to hide lighted numerals. If you need to get up at a specific time, set your alarm. If you awaken from sleep, don't look at the clock. Tell yourself, if the alarm hasn't gone off, "it's time to sleep," and allow yourself to return to sleep.

**Use a nightlight in your bedroom and bathroom.** Bright lights send a wake-up signal to the brain. Add a nightlight to your grip, so you’ll have it when you sleep away from home.

**Keep pets out of your bedroom.** Their movements likely will lighten your sleep.

**Adjust room temperature to your liking.** Most people sleep better in a cool room, with the thermostat set between 60o F and 68o F.

**Is it time for a new mattress or pillow?** You need to be comfortable.
