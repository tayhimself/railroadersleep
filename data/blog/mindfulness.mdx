Mindfulness practices in organizational settings are becoming very popular.  They range from multiple week training courses in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to yoga practices, and various types of mediation-related micro-practices, including walking and sitting meditation, movement meditation, and mindfulness moments structured into on-going work activities. Mindfulness has become a billion dollar a year industry, with a vast number mindfulness-mediated activities such as online apps.

Mindfulness has been defined as paying focused attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental manner. Regular practice of mindfulness decreases rumination and emotional reactivity, thereby possibly improving sleep. A meta-analysis of clinical trials investigating the effect of mindfulness on sleep showed improvements in sleep quality, but most of the reviewed studies were in clinical populations including patients with cancer and insomnia.

Mindfulness has also been shown to reduce burnout, stress, anxiety and depression. Further, reduction in stress and anxiety may have a secondary benefit in improving sleep. In the post-pandemic global corporate wellness environment, more than half of US employers offer some form of mindfulness training to their employees. Common programs include online apps such as Calm or Headspace.
