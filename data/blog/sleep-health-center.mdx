If you do everything you can to foster good sleep, but still don’t get as much sleep as you need, or don’t feel rested when you awaken, you may have a sleep disorder or another health problem that causes these difficulties. Treatment can help you sleep better, and feel better, too.


Talk to a healthcare provider if you:

- Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
- Feel the amount of sleep you get is insufficient or poor
- Constantly feel sleepy or foggy while awake
- Have been told you snore or move your legs repeatedly in sleep
- You may have a sleep disorder. Fortunately, treatments available today can help you sleep better, perform better at work, and feel better in your waking hours.

Your healthcare provider may suggest that you see a sleep specialist, and refer you to a sleep center in your area. It is likely that your medical insurance covers sleep disorders screening and treatment. Check with your provider to be certain.
