If you do everything you can to foster good sleep, but still don’t get as much sleep as you need, or don’t feel rested when you awaken, you may have a sleep disorder or another health problem that causes these difficulties. Treatment can help you sleep better, and feel better, too.


Talk to a healthcare provider if you:

Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
Feel the amount of sleep you get is insufficient or poor
Constantly feel sleepy or foggy while awake
Have been told you snore or move your legs repeatedly in sleep
You may have a sleep disorder. Fortunately, treatments available today can help you sleep better, perform better at work, and feel better in your waking hours.

Your healthcare provider may suggest that you see a sleep specialist, and refer you to a sleep center in your area. It is likely that your medical insurance covers sleep disorders screening and treatment. Check with your provider to be certain.
