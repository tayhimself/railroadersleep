Savvy railroaders have devised tactics to cope with their often unpredictable hours. They have figured out how to best get sleep in daylight hours, when sunlight, noise, and other factors make sleep shorter or less restful than it would be at night. They manage to sleep in railroad sleeping quarters or hotels that lack the comforts of home. They nap when they can to boost alertness.

These railroaders know it is normal to have ups and downs in alertness and sleepiness over the day. They pay attention to their own body rhythms, and take steps to avoid lapses in attention and nodding off.
