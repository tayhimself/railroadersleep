Promote good sleep in those close to you. The railroader’s life shapes family life. Family members’ sleep times sometimes may shift in response to your schedule. They may stay up late to talk with you while you’re away, or welcome you back home. They may get up early to share a meal, and see you off. Family members know you need to sleep well while at home. Do what you can to assure that they sleep well, too. All members of your household need sufficient sleep to feel well rested, perform well in their own jobs or at school, and to enjoy family life.

Ask for your family's patience if you feel tired and cranky when you get home. It’s hard to handle chores and other family responsibilities after a demanding work day. Try to get your sleep, and then jump in.

Don't expect family members to tiptoe while you sleep. Good soundproofing for your bedroom will allow you to sleep, and your family to talk on the phone, watch TV, or listen to music at the same time. Some railroaders sleep in a room separate from that of their spouse or partner, a tactic that lets them both get the sleep they need.

Stay in touch when away from home. Talk, text, or email family and friends regularly. Use Skype, FaceTime, or other apps to share smiles, and talk about your day.

If worried about family security, install an alarm system, or consider getting a dog, if other family members are willing to take on the responsibilities of caring for a pet. Every home needs a smoke alarm. If you have fuel-burning appliances, you also need a carbon monoxide detector. Ensuring your family’s safety will give you and everyone else peace of mind.
