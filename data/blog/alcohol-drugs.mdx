### ALCOHOL
On top of the negative effects that alcohol has on a developing brain and body, normal sleep cycles are disrupted by alcohol. This causes the body to enter a deep sleep too quickly.
In addition, cycling through normal REM sleep is suppressed during the first half of the night. This stage of sleep, when rapid eye movements occur behind closed lids, is necessary for maintaining healthy brain function.
Drinking alcohol also makes people more likely to sleep badly and wake up often during the second half of the night.

### ADHD MEDICINES
Medicines prescribed for attention-deficit disorders (like ADHD or ADD) should never be taken unless they are prescribed by your doctor and used as directed.
Adderall, Ritalin, and other stimulant medications used to treat these disorders can make it hard to fall asleep and can cause other side effects, such as a racing heartbeat and high blood pressure.
Overdoses of these medicines can cause very serious health problems, including an irregular heartbeat, hallucinations, and even coma.

### NICOTINE
Besides being illegal for minors and unhealthy for everyone, smoking and chewing tobacco can reduce your quality of sleep. Nicotine-which is found in cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and chewing tobacco--is a stimulant, and can keep the brain from entering deep sleep.
Ongoing research in mice also shows that exposure to cigarette smoke alters how genes that control the body clock are expressed, disrupting circadian rhythms.
E-cigarettes are not a safe choice, either. With vaping, even though there's no smoke, nicotine is still going into vour svsten

### MELATONIN AND SLEEPING PILLS
Melatonin is a hormone made in the brain that naturally rises at night to help promote sleep.
Although a few studies have shown that taking melatonin pills before bedtime can help with insomnia, its effectiveness has not been clearly established, and the best dosage and timing are not known.
If you're having trouble sleeping, first talk to your doctor about the best treatment plan, which often doesn't include taking any sleeping medicines, including melatonin.
