### Don't wait to find out

There are many tools designed to help you get to the bottom of sleep challenges you face.

Keeping a daily focus on sleep by charting your sleep on paper or electronically and/or wearing a sleep tracker and by checking your alertness throughout the day and work cycles, you may be able to address sleep issues before they become long-term bad habits.

In addition to the resources in the Sleep Toolkit, you may be interested in screening yourself for five of the most common sleep disorders using the [Anonymous Sleep Disorders Screening Tool](https://sleepscreen.netlify.app/).
