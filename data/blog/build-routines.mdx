Routines are essential, even when your job is anything but routine.

Choosing to organize your schedule, create a comfortable sleep environment, and plan ahead for work hours, are just some examples of ways to set up and follow routines that will help you get the rest you need to perform well on the job.

Routines don't have to be considered boring. They help you set up and keep a consistent structure at work and at home that you and your family can rely upon.

Here are some routines to consider:

**Exercise regularly.** Devise a routine you can take on the road. Add exercise cords or resistance bands to your grip, along with shoes and other items you need. A multitude of exercise apps are availble to help you with your exercise routine.

**Drink a lot of water.** Regular water intake will keep you hydrated and feeling more mentally crisp. Dehydration makes your body feel run down.

In order to optimize alertness, **get in the habit of making checklists** for periods when you know you may be sleepy. Follow the checklists during those times.
