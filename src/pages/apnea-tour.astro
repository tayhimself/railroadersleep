				Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that affects a
				significant portion of the population. It occurs when the upper airway
				becomes partially or completely blocked during sleep, leading to
				interruptions in breathing and causing oxygen levels in the blood to
				drop.
				<p>
					This can result in a range of symptoms, including loud snoring,
					gasping or choking during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and difficulty
					concentrating. OSA can also lead to more serious health issues, such
					as high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.
				</p>
				The importance of OSA to railroaders and safety is significant. Sleep deprivation
				and fatigue can impair cognitive functioning and reaction time, increasing
				the likelihood of errors and accidents.

					quote="After the first night that I wore the CPAP air machine and slept all night, the next day, when I woke up, I said to myself, 'This is what it's like to sleep all night? This is wonderful!' I felt like a million dollars. I felt like Superman.  Ever since, I've used the CPAP air machine every night when I go to bed, and it’s improved my health. It's also made my life less stressful, because I'm more rested. I bought another CPAP air machine, and I keep that up at my hotel at my away-from-home terminal. Our job, our safety, depends on how rested we are."

					quote="A guy that I worked with came in with a line on his face, and we started talking about that. He told me about his mask, and we started talking about snoring and everything else, and I thought wow, you know, I think I have it. And then I went in for a sleep study. I’ve been on the CPAP machine since 2000. If I don’t use my machine, my sleep is terrible. I have a machine at home, and another that I leave at my away-from-home terminal."
